title: What is Data Science?
---

This course is about doing data science with Python, which immediately begs the question: _what is data science?_

Data science is an interdisciplinary field that combines statistics, mathematics, computer science, and domain knowledge to extract insights and knowledge from data. It involves the entire process of collecting, processing, analyzing, and interpreting data to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships that can inform decision-making and drive innovation.

In essence, data science is the practice of using data to solve real-world problems. It encompasses a wide range of techniques and tools, including machine learning, predictive modeling, data mining, data visualization, and statistical analysis, among others.

Although some of the labels on the overlapping circles are phrased in a lighthearted way, this diagram represents the core meaning of the term "**data science**": it is a field that combines multiple disciplines. Data science consists of three distinct but interconnected areas: the skills of a statistician trained in modeling and summarizing data sets (which are continually increasing in size); the skills of a computer scientist who can design and implement algorithms to efficiently store, process, and visualize data; and subject-matter expertise—what could be considered "traditional" training in a particular domain—necessary for both formulating the correct inquiries and interpreting their answers in context.

From this perspective, data science should be considered not as an entirely new discipline to study, but rather a new set of capabilities that can be applied within one's existing area of expertise. Whether investigating consumer spending patterns, forecasting weather events, enhancing manufacturing processes, mapping biodiversity across ecosystems, studying the formation of galaxies, or exploring data in any other field, the aim of this course is to empower participants to formulate and address new inquiries relevant to their chosen area of study.
