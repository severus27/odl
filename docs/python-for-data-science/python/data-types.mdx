In programming, data types are the classifications of different kinds of values that a program can work with. Each data type has its own set of rules and operations that can be performed on it.
In Python, there are several built-in data types, and each type has its own set of characteristics and operations that can be performed on them.

However, in this course, we will focus on the basic data types that are frequently used.


## Integers

Integers are numbers without any fractional part and can be positive (`1`, `2`, `3`, ...), negative (`-1`, `-2`, `-3`, ...), or zero (`0`).

In the code cell below, we set a variable x to an integer. We then verify the data type with `type()`, and need only pass the variable name into the parentheses.

```py
x = 10
print(x)
print(type(x))
```

```sh title="Output"
10
<class 'int'>
```

In the output above, `<class 'int'>` refers to the integer data type.

## Floats

Floating-point numbers are decimal numbers, containing a fractional part.

```py
pi = 3.14159265358979323846264  # nearly pi
print(pi)
print(type(pi))
```

```sh title="Output"
3.141592653589793
<class 'float'>
```

We can also specify a float with a fraction.

```py
pi = 22/7
print(pi)
print(type(pi))
```

```sh title="Output"
3.142857142857143
<class 'float'>
```

In the above output, the decimal number seems too big. Generally, we only need decimals up to four places for most things, anything beyond that often doesn't significantly change the value.

One function that is particularly useful for such fractions is the `round()` function. It lets you round a number to a specified number of decimal places.

```py
pi = 22/7
rounded_pi = round(pi, 4)  # Round to 4 decimal places
print(rounded_pi)
print(type(rounded_pi))
```

```sh title="Output"
3.1428
<class 'float'>
```

:::note
It's important to note that integers and floats have different behaviors and properties. For example, dividing two integers will result in an integer, while dividing a float by an integer or another float will produce a float:

```py
result1 = 10 / 3
result2 = 10 // 3
```

```sh title="Output"
3.3333333333333335
3
```

:::

In the first calculation, `10 / 3` results in a float (`3.3333333333333335`) because at least one of the operands is a float (Python treats `10` as `10.0` in this case). In the second calculation, `10 // 3` performs integer division, resulting in an integer (`3`).

:::note
Whenever you write an number with a decimal point, Python recognizes it as a float data type.

For example, `7.` (or `7.0`, `7.00`, etc) will be recognized as a float. This is the case, even though these numbers technically have no fractional part!

```py
x = 7.
print(x)
print(type(x))
```

```sh title="Output"
7.0
<class 'float'>
```

:::

## Booleans

Booleans represent one of two possible values: `True` or `False`. These values are used to express logical conditions and control the flow of a program.

In the code cell below, we'll set the variable `x` to a Boolean value of `True`:

```py
x = True
print(x)
print(type(x))
```

```sh title="Output"
True
<class 'bool'>
```

### Comparison Operators

We can use comparison operators like `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=` to compare values and get a Boolean result.

```py
x = 5
y = 10
print(x == y)   # Output: False
print(x != y)   # Output: True
print(x < y)    # Output: True
print(x > y)    # Output: False
print(x <= y)   # Output: True
print(x >= y)   # Output: False
```

### Boolean Operators

Python provides logical operators `and`, `or`, and `not` to combine or negate Boolean values.

```py
age = 18
is_student = True

print(age >= 18 and is_student)  # Output: True (both conditions are True)
print(age >= 21 or is_student)   # Output: True (at least one condition is True)
print(not is_student)           # Output: False (negation of True)
```

### Conditional Statements

Booleans are essential for controlling the flow of a program using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.

```py
num = 7

if num > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")
elif num < 0:
    print("The number is negative.")
else:
    print("The number is zero.")
```

```sh title="Output"
The number is positive.
```

## Strings

Strings in Python are a sequence of characters (like alphabet, numerical digits, or symbols) enclosed within single quotes (`'`), double quotes (`"`), or triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`).

### String Literals

You can create string literals by enclosing the characters within single, double, or triple quotes.

```py
message1 = 'Hello, world!'
message2 = "Python is awesome!"
message3 = '''This is a
multi-line
string.'''

print(message1)
print(message2)
print(message3)
```

```sh title="Output"
Hello, world!
Python is awesome!
This is a
multi-line
string.
```

### String Indexing and Slicing

Strings are zero-indexed, meaning the first character has an index of `0`. You can access individual characters or substrings using indexing and slicing.

```py
greeting = "Hello, Python!"
print(greeting[0])
print(greeting[7:13])
```

```sh title="Output"
'H'
'Python'
```

### String Concatenation

You can combine strings using the `+` operator to create a new string.

```py
first_name = "John"
last_name = "Doe"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print(full_name)
```

```sh title="Output"
"John Doe"
```

:::note
You can't subtract or divide two strings. Also, you can't multiply two strings together, but you can repeat a string by multiplying it with a number. This makes a new string that's the original one repeated the specified number of times.

```py
str_multiply = "python" * 4
print(str_multiply)
print(type(str_multiply))
```

```sh title="Output"
pythonpythonpythonpython
```
