title: Basic Syntax and Data Types
description: Make calculations, and define and modify variables.
---

In this module, we'll learn about the fundamental building blocks of Python programming. We'll start by understanding how to define and use variables, which are like containers that hold data in our programs. Then, we'll explore the basic data types that Python provides, such as numbers, strings, and booleans. Finally, we'll discuss the importance of comments and indentation in Python code.

## Variables and Assignments

Variables are used to store values in a program. You can think of them as named boxes where you can put different kinds of data.

### Defining variables

To create a new variable in Python, you simply choose a name for it and assign a value using the `=` operator. Here's an example:

```py
x = 5  # Assigning the value 5 to the variable x
```

In this case, we've created a variable named `x` and assigned it the value `5`.

### Printing Variables

To display the value of a variable, you can use the `print()` function:

```py
x = 5
print(x)  # Output: 5
```

The `print()` function is used to output data to the console or terminal.

### Variable naming conventions

In Python, variable names should follow certain rules:

- They must start with a letter or an underscore (`_`).
- They can contain letters, digits, and underscores.
- They are case-sensitive, meaning that `myVar` and `myvar` are two different variables.

It's also a good practice to choose descriptive variable names that reflect the purpose of the data they hold.

```py
age = 25
print(age)  # Output: 25
```

### Assignment operators

Python provides several assignment operators that allow you to modify the value of a variable. The most common one is the `=` operator, which assigns a new value to the variable:

```py
x = 10
print(x)  # Output: 10
x = x + 5
print(x)  # Output: 15
```

There are also other assignment operators like +=, -=, \*=, and /= that perform operations and assign the result back to the variable.

## Basic Data Types

Python has several built-in data types for storing different kinds of values. Let's explore the basic ones:

### Numbers

Python supports two main types of numbers:

- Integers are whole numbers, such as 3, 42, or -10.
- Floats are decimal numbers, such as 3.14, 0.5, or -2.7.

You can perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on numbers.

```py
num1 = 10
num2 = 3.14
print(num1 + num2)  # Output: 13.14
print(num1 * num2)  # Output: 31.4
```

### Strings

Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in quotes. You can use single quotes (`'`), double quotes (`"`), or triple quotes (`""""`).

```py
message = "Hello, World!"
print(message)

# Output: Hello, World!

multiline_string = """This is
a multiline
string."""
print(multiline_string)

# Output: This is
#          a multiline
#          string.
```

### Booleans

Booleans represent truth values: True or False. They are often used in conditional statements and loops, which we'll cover later.

```py
is_raining = True
is_sunny = False
print(is_raining)  # Output: True
print(is_sunny)    # Output: False
```

### Comments

Comments are notes or explanations in your code that are ignored by the Python interpreter. They are useful for documenting your code and making it more readable for yourself and others.

#### Single-line and multi-line comments

- Single-line comments start with the `#` symbol:

```py
# This is a single-line comment
print("Hello")  # This is another single-line comment
```

- Multi-line comments can be created using triple quotes (`""""`):

```py
"""
This is
a multi-line
comment.  
"""
# the above code will be ignored

print("Hello, again!")
```

### Indentation

Indentation is crucial in Python because it is used to define code blocks instead of curly braces or keywords like `begin` and `end`. Code blocks are indicated by indenting the lines with spaces or tabs.

```py
x = 10

if x > 5:  # This line is not indented
    print("x is greater than 5")  # This line is indented
    print("Inside the block")  # This line is indented
```
