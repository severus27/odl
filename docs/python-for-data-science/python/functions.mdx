A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It takes input, processes it, and may return output. Functions promote code reuse, modularity, and readability. The anatomy of a function includes its name, parameters, and return value.

### Defining a Function

To define a function, you use the `def` keyword followed by the function name, parameter list enclosed in parentheses, and an indented block of code that makes up the function body. The `return` statement is used to send the output of the function back to the caller. 

### Calling a Function

To call a function, you use its name followed by parentheses, passing any required arguments.

For example, to define a function named `function_name` that takes two parameters (`param1` and `param2`) and returns an output, you would write:

```py
def function_name(param1, param2):
    # Function body
    return output
```

To call this function and assign the return value to a variable named `result`, you would write:

```py
result = function_name(arg1, arg2)
```
