# Contributing to OpenDeepLearning

[OpenDeepLearning](#) is a collaborative open-source community committed to improving the accessibility of AI education for all. If you're interested in contributing to OpenDeepLearning, hopefully, this document makes the process for contributing clear.

The [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/) website has a collection of resources for individuals, communities, and companies who want to learn how to run and contribute to an open source project. Contributors and people new to open source alike will find the following guides especially useful:

- [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
