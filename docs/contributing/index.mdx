# Contributing to OpenDeepLearning

Greetings! We're thrilled that you're interested in contributing to OpenDeepLearning. As an open-source organization in a rapidly evolving field, we welcome a wide range of contributions, from new features and enhanced infrastructure to improved documentation, blog posts, courses, and bug fixes.

## 🧭 Guidelines

### 🧑🏻‍💻 Ways to contribute

There are many ways to contribute to OpenDeepLearning, and many of them do not involve writing any code. Here's a few ideas to get started:

- [Check open issues](#): Offer solutions, seek clarity, or recommend labels. Assist in issue management.
- [Contribute fixes](#): Open a pull request for issues, especially those labeled as "Good first issue".
- [Propose topics](#): Share new ideas or resources by opening an issue and suggesting topics.
- [Translating site](#): Aid in accessibility by translating the site into different languages.

Contributions are very welcome. If you think you need help planning your contribution, please ping us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Open_DL_AI) and let us know you are looking for a bit of help.

### 🚧 GitHub Issues

Our [issues](#) page is regularly updated with bugs, improvements, and feature requests. We've implemented a labeling system to assist in sorting and discovering relevant issues. Kindly assign yourself to any issue you begin working on.

When adding an issue, please ensure it remains focused on a single, modular bug, improvement, or feature. If related issues arise or if there are blockers, please link them instead of merging them.

We strive to maintain these issues as current as possible. However, given the fast pace of development in this field, some may become outdated. If you observe this, please inform us promptly.

### 💭 GitHub Discussions

Explore our [discussions](#) page, where users engage in conversations, seek guidance on usage, deliberate design choices, and suggest innovative features.

If you're capable of addressing queries, lend a hand! This empowers maintainers to dedicate additional time to development and resolving issues.

### 🙋‍♀️ Getting Help

If you encounter any challenges while contributing to OpenDeepLearning, don't hesitate to reach out to the maintainer for assistance. We have a vibrant community of developers on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/QgZHExcssR) ready to help you overcome any obstacles.
