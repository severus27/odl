If you find it challenging to set up the guide on your local machine, and the process of navigating GitHub seems intimidating, fear not. You can still contribute to the project with ease by using the `"Edit this page"` button conveniently located at the bottom left of the page. 

This approach is particularly user-friendly. By clicking that button, you can make updates using [Extended Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/) (MDX), which is an extended version of Markdown that allows embedding components and React code in your content.

### Button

Here's what the button looks like:
