OpenDeepLearning utilizes [Extended Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/) to create and manage the content you see here. 

Extended Markdown is a powerful markup language that combines Markdown's simplicity with React components' flexibility, allowing users to write content with both Markdown syntax and interactive React elements.

## Using Extended Markdown

To write Extended Markdown, you have to create files with the `.mdx` extension. Within these files, you can follow the standard [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and additionally use [JSX syntax](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) to embed React components directly into your Markdown content. 

Here's an example of how you can write MDX:

```mdx title="example.mdx"
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';
import Code from './Code';

# This is a Heading

This is a paragraph with **bold** and _italic_ text.

- This is a list item
- And another one

You can embed React components like this:

<MyComponent someProperty="value" />
```

This example shows how to use React components in Markdown files. The code embeds the `<MyComponent>` with a prop, and an inline component. It imports `MyComponent` and the inline component from separate files before using them in the MDX file.
