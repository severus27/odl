[OpenDeepLearning](#) was founded in 2023 by [Severus](https://github.com/severus27), an avid learner of machine learning and deep learning. Severus had been educating himself in artificial intelligence from free online resources, such as books, blogs and courses. He identified a gap in comprehensive AI guidance despite the availability of learning materials, which also hindered his younger brother's learning. As an open source and AI advocate, he founded [OpenDeepLearning community](https://discord.com/invite/QgZHExcssR) to offer a structured and supportive learning environment for AI enthusiasts seeking a clear learning path.
